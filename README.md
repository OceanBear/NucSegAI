# NucSegAI

## Introduction

NucSegAI is a deep learning model for automated nuclear segmentation and cell-type classification in H&E-stained histology images. NucSegAI is based on the HoverNet backbone, and is trained on H&E-stained images with paired multiplex immunofluorescence imaging data.

## Why NucSegAI

Existing deep-learning models for nuclear segmentation and cell-type classification are mostly trained on human-annotated H&E images, with performance often constrained by the limited number of labeled instances. Moreover, intra- and inter-observer variability in manual annotations can further hinder model accuracy. In contrast, **NucSegAI** is trained on large-scale H&E-stained images paired with multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) data, where cell types are objectively defined based on the expression of lineage-specific markers, providing more reliable supervision.

## Class labels

0: Undefined \
1: Epithelium (PD-L1 low and Ki67 low) \
2: Epithelium (PD-L1 hi or Ki67 hi) \
3: Macrophage \
4: Lymphocyte \
5: Vascular \
6: Fibroblast/Stroma

## Environment setup

1. Create a new conda environment: `conda create -n nucsegai python=3.9`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate nucsegai`
3. Install the library requirements for HoverNet: `pip install src_hovernet/requirements.txt`
4. Install the stain-tools: `pip install staintools`

## Image preparation

1. Images can be either patches/tiles in `.tiff` or whole-slide images (WSI) in `.svs`. 

2. Images are assumed to be captured at 40X magnification, with a resolution of 0.25 um/pixel. Improper resolution will generate suboptimal results. 

2. During model development, we found staining normalization is critical for generating accurate results. Images must be stain normalized before applying the model:

- `python3 stain_norm.py`

## Inference

1. Download the model weights from the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/OGevaertLab/NucSegAI/).

- Colorectal cancer: NucSegAI_CRC.tar
- Non-small-cell lung cancer: NucSegAI_NSCLC.tar 

2. Place the tar file(s) into a `model_bin/` folder under the same directory with this repo. 

3. Run `src_hovernet/run_tile.sh` for tile inference or `src_hovernet/run_wsi.sh` for WSI inference.
